The git status command shows the differences made since the last commit. Not as detailed as the 

The git diff command outputs the changes that have been made that haven't been staged yet.
The git diff HEAD command outputs the changes that have been made that both have and haven't been staged yet

The git commit command saves a local snapshot of the staging area.
The git commit -a command does the same as 'git commit', but executes 'git add' on all tracked files beforehand.
