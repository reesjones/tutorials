## What's happening

Each `.xml` file is a short example of an ANT tag's usage. 

`file1` is given. `file1Copy` is created with `copy.xml`. `file2` is created with `move.xml`.
`file3` is created with `touch.xml`.


## new-command.xml

`new-command.xml` is an ant file used for initializing a new `.xml` file based on `shell.xml`
to test a certain command.
